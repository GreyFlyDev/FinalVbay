<h2>The Rules</h2>
<div class="col-md-10">
    <p>
        The V-bay guidelines were established by the County Manager to ensure the successful and continued operation of V-bay for the enjoyment of all employees. The V-bay Moderator reviews all ads to ensure they comply with the guidelines and reserves the right to gently edit them for clarity, spelling, and appropriateness. Your cooperation in following these rules is greatly appreciated.

        V-bay is an opportunity for employees to advertise personal items for sale or advertise for items they would like to buy. Employees may also advertise upcoming yard or garage sales, or fundraisers for non-profit organizations that they may be involved with. 
    </p>
    <p>Please observe the following rules when creating your ad: </p>
    <div class="alert-danger">
        <p>
            Do not list work phone numbers or work emails in your advertisement. Use only your home or cell phone number and/or your personal email address. An email address is requested when you create your ad in the event the Moderator needs to contact you. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert-warning">
        <p>
            Commercial advertising is prohibited. This includes lawn services, Avon, etc. Ads seeking these services also are not allowed. For example: "Electrician wanted," or "Seeking babysitter for my children." 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert-danger">
        <p>
            Ads for items that you create specifically to sell, such as food, crafts, etc., are considered employee businesses and are not allowed. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert-warning">
        <p>
            No weapons, such as knives, guns, swords, etc. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert-danger">
        <p>
            No personal ads (i.e., ads looking for boyfriends, girlfriends, etc.). 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert-warning">
        <p>
            One ad per item at a time is allowed. Please do not post your ad, then post the same ad again three days later. If you want to revise or update your original ad, contact the Moderator via email. If you do not receive a response to your ad, you are welcome to resubmit it once it expires.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert-danger">
        <p>
            No rentals. This means no ads renting homes, apartments or other items and no ads seeking to rent a home, apartment or other item. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert-warning">
        <p>
            Fundraisers for legitimate, non-profit organizations are allowed within reason. For example, your child is selling Girl Scout cookies. You may advertise the sale and item. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert-danger">
        <p>
            V-bay is not an announcement forum. Notices for club meetings, church services, etc. are not permitted. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert-warning">
        <p>
            V-bay ads are by employees for employees. Please do not post ads for your friends and neighbors, only for you or your immediate family
        </p>

            Because Volusia County Government is actively seeking ways to reduce the number of animals euthanized each year, V-bay no longer accepts ads offering dogs or cats for sale or ads seeking or offering stud services. V-bay will continue to allow ads giving away a dog, cat or other pet for free in hopes that the animal will find a new home. Please be aware that the Volusia County Animal Control Code of Ordinances requires dogs and cats in unincorporated Volusia to be spayed or neutered and that dogs and cats offered for sale or free must have an official health certificate. Please be a responsible pet owner and spay or neuter your pet! For more information, please contact Volusia County's Animal Control Division.

            Please note that the purchase of a used child safety seat may be a danger to a child. Not knowing the history of the seat (for example - was it purchased new, has it been involved in a motor vehicle crash, does it have any missing parts, are the instructions with it, has it been properly maintained, are all the stickers present) can make it an unsafe device. One also must be aware of the date of manufacture as child safety seats are only recommended for use for six years from that date due to breakdown of the plastics from the sun and heat.
